| Artificial Intelligence
| Foundational
| A broad field of computer science concerned with building systems that can
perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. These tasks
include reasoning, learning, problem solving, understanding language, and
recognising patterns.

| Large Language Model (LLM)
|
| A category of machine learning model trained on large volumes of text
data using a transformer architecture. Designed to understand, reason
over, and generate human language at scale. LLMs are the foundation of
most modern AI assistants, code generation tools, and document processing
capabilities.

| Machine Learning
|
| A specific approach to artificial intelligence in which systems learn to perform
tasks by identifying patterns in data rather than being explicitly programmed
with rules. A machine learning system improves its performance on a task as
it is exposed to more data.

| Model
| Foundational
| A mathematical structure trained on data to recognise patterns and produce
outputs such as predictions, classifications, or generated content. A model
is the artifact that results from training, it encodes learned relationships
between inputs and outputs without explicitly being programmed with rules.

| Structured Data
| Data Classification
| Data that is organised into a predefined schema with clearly defined
fields, types, and relationships. It is stored in a format that makes it
directly queryable and processable without transformation.

| Unstructured Data
| Data Classification
| Data that does not conform to a predefined schema or data model. It
carries information but requires interpretation, transformation, or
specialised processing to extract meaning from it in a consistent way.
